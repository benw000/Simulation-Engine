# Crowd-Simulation
Python learning project Oct 2024

Aims:
----
-Create a crowd simulation script, which will take a number of pedestrians and model their movement with a force-based model

-This should take initial positions, a custom 2D environment, and update each pedestrians position and velocity at each timestep

-This should be done following Git and Python best practices, using class instances for each pedestrian. Use git terminal commands, and commit from develop branch to main.

-This should store information in an updated CSV file for each run

-At the end of the computation, the script should read the CSV by line and create an mp4 video

Extensions:
-----
-Replace CSV format with YAML or SQL

-Create a pop up window where you click on a screen to initialise positions, and specify a velocity

-Click run, it will show 'processing', and then show you an embedded video

-Port all of this to HTML which has a Python backend
