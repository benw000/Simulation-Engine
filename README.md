### General physics engine for force-based particle simulations, built from scratch in Python.

I'm interested in numerical simulation and modelling. I noticed that a lot of my previous simulation projects tended to share the same workflow: **initialisation**, **force-based timestepping**, **logging** and **rendering**. 

So to save myself 30 whole minutes of *gruelling, predictable* setup, I've spent the last year (on and off) working on this engine!

## 📍 Introduction

My simulation engine, or *bengine*, is a Python package featuring a commmand-line interface (CLI), where the user can choose from a number of preset simulation types to run - these pop up as little windows showing the final simulation on-loop:

Please have a quick scroll through the rest of this `README` if you'd like to learn more:
- See [Get Started](#get-started) and [Usage](#-usage) to install and try out the package! (this would make me very happy 🥺)
- See [Examples](#-examples) for an overview of the different force-based models currently implemented. 🎓
- See [Design Features](#-design-features), [Project Structure](#-project-structure), [Dependencies](#-dependencies), and [Next Steps](#-next-steps) for all the juicy details about the project. ☝️🤓

## 🧑‍💻 Usage:

Below is a quick example showing most main command arguments.
#### Run a simulation
![run_terminal_screenshot](data/demo_videos/run_usage.png)
- Run a [Predator-Prey](#predator-prey-model-) simulation, with 10 Prey and 3 Predators
- Set the timestep duration to 0.01 seconds, and use 200 timesteps in total.
- Record a log of each particle's position, velocity etc. at each timestep in a readable `.ndjson` log, with a custom file path.
- Save an `.mp4` video of the simulation inside a custom folder path.

#### Load a simulation from logs
![load_terminal_screenshot](data/demo_videos/load_usage.png)
This reads the simulation you just logged and renders it again.

#### All arguments
Find help for all arguments with `bengine -h`:

## 🌟 Examples:

### N-body Gravitational Dynamics 💫 
![nbody-gif](data/demo_videos/nbody_demo.gif)

#### Run this 
```shell
bengine run nbody -n 30
```
#### Description

- Bodies are initialised with random positions and velocities, and masses of different magnitudes, chosen from a log-uniform distribution scale. 
- Each body feels a gravitational attraction towards every other body in the system. Larger bodies attract smaller ones, which accelerate towards them. 
- To a first order level of approximation, these smaller bodies then engage in elliptic orbits around the larger body, or are deflected, shooting off on a parabolic trajectory. As more bodies shoot off, their density in our viewing window decreases.

#### Forces
- Gravitational attraction force - each body is attracted to every other body in the system, following Newton's law of universal gravitation: \
$F = G \frac{Mass_1 Mass_2}{Distance^2}$.

### Classroom Evacuation Model 🎓

![evac-gif](data/demo_videos/evac_demo.gif)

#### Run this 
```shell
bengine run evac -n 40 -t 200
```

#### Description

- People are initialised at random points in the classroom, and make their way to the nearest exit, periodically re-evaluating which exit to use. 
- The graph on the right shows the number of people evacuated over time, which can be used to score different classroom layouts for fire safety.
- Layouts are easily created by specifying pairs of vertices for each wall (seen in red), and specifying a number of target locations (green crosses).

**Forces**
- Constant attraction force to an individual's chosen target exit.
- Repulsion force between people - active within a personal space threshold, scales with $ \frac{1}{Distance}$
- Repulsion force from walls - also active within a threshold, scales with $ \frac{1}{Distance^2}$
- Deflection force from walls - force acting along length of wall towards an individual's target, prevents gridlock when a wall obscures the target.
- Stochastic force - a small amount of noise is applied.
- Note that additional bespoke forces would have to be specified in order to encode more intelligent, calculating behaviour.

### Spring System Model 🔗

![springs-gif](data/demo_videos/springs_demo.gif)

#### Run this 
```shell
bengine run springs -n 50  -t 30
```

#### Description

- Point particles are initialised at random positions on the plane; if a neighbour is within a spring length away, a spring is formed. Particles with no connections are culled before step 0. 
- We see larger molecules start to form as networks of connected particles reach an equillibrium. 
- Setting a larger spring length allows more particles to connect to eachother, increasing the complexity of the structures formed.

**Forces** 
- Elastic force following Hooke's law: $F = -k \cdot (Spring \  Extension)$ \
This acts on both particles whenever the spring between them is in compression (red), or extension (yellow).
- Damping force - directly opposes particle motion, scaling linearly with velocity.
- Stochastic force - a small amount of random noise is applied to each particle.

### Predator-Prey Model 🦅

![birds-gif](data/demo_videos/birds_demo.gif)

#### Run this 
```shell
bengine run -n 50 5 -t 200
```

#### Description

- Prey (white) and Predator (red) birds are initialised at random points. 
- The Predators act to hunt each Prey, always pursuing the closest bird and killing it within a certain distance threshold. 
- The Prey avoid the Predators, and flock together to increase chances of survival. 
- This all takes place on a torus topological domain, where opposite edges are connected with periodic boundary conditions. 
- The Predators aren't particularly intelligent, since their motion is governed by simple blind attraction at each timestep.

**Forces**
- Prey repulsion from all Predators within a radius of detection, scaling with $ \frac{1}{Distance}$ 
- Predator attraction to closest Pre with constant magnitude.
- Constant attraction force on Prey towards the centre of mass of all Prey birds - this naïvely encodes flocking behaviour.
- Repulsion force between birds - active within a personal space threshold, scales with $ \frac{1}{Distance}$.
- Stochastic force - a fair amount of noise is applied to the prey, to simulate erratic movements to throw off predators. Less noise is applied to the predators, which are very direct.

### 8-ball pool breaking simulation 🎱

![pool-gif](data/demo_videos/pool_demo.gif)

#### Run this 
```shell
bengine run pool -n 1 -t 500
```

#### Description

- Pool balls are initialised in the normal setup, the cue ball starting off firing into the triangle with a slight random vertical deviance. 
- Balls repel off eachother, simulating elastic collision, and reflect off of the cushion walls, being removed if they hit the target of any pocket.

**Forces**
- Repulsion force between contacting balls - very strong but active within a small range, scaling with $ \frac{1}{Distance}$.
- Normal force from wall - this models each cushion as a spring, with any compression from incoming balls resulting in an outwards normal force on the ball, following Hooke's law.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

#### Pre-requisites
- Python 3.9 - similar versions should work fine, but I've only fully tested on 3.9.4. Please see the [pyenv guide](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) on how to manage multiple python versions on your system if you are using a different version.
- FFmpeg - see [installation guide](#ffmpeg) below.

#### Installing the package
Please make sure your tools are up to date:
```bash
# (Inside virtual environment)
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

#### Matplotlib rendering
(Linux / WSL) If you see:
```
UserWarning: Matplotlib is currently using agg, which is a non-GUI backend, so cannot show the figure.
```
Try using the `TkAgg` GUI rendering backend for `matplotlib` by setting the following environment variable in your shell:
```bash
export MPLBACKEND=TkAgg
```
If this doesn't work, you may need to download `tkinter` for python in order to use the `TkAgg` backend.
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
After this you may need to reinstall python, now with `tkinter`.

#### Still stuck?
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/benw000/Simulation-Engine/issues) on GitHub — include your OS, Python version, and any error messages. Thank you!
